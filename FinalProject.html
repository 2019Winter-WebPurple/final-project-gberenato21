            <p>Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to venture into space. In 1963, she spent about 3 days in space and managed to orbit the Earth 48 times in her space capsule, Vostok 6. This was sadly her only trip to space. Tereshkova received 18 months of training and was picked out of five women to go to space. Her mission was chosen to be a dual mission with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Valery-Bykovsky"target="_blank">Valeriy Bykovsky</a>, who would be launching on Vostok 5. Tereshkova logged more than 70 hours in space and managed to come within a 3 mile radius of Bykovsky. What the two did not realize was that the flight almost turned into a tragedy.</p>

            <h3>Saved From Tragedy</h3>
            <p>Due to an error in the spacecraft's automatic navigation software, the ship started to move away from Earth. Tereshkova noticed this and scientists quickly developed a new landing algorithm. She managed to land safely with only a bruise on her face. After Tereshkova's landing in the Altay region, she received an honor with the title <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level1/tereshkova.html"target="_blank">Honor of the Soviet Union</a>.</p>
